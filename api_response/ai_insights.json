    "findings": "### 1. Key Findings About Failure Patterns:\n- **High Risk Items Prevalence**: With 104 high-risk failure modes out of 264 total, nearly 40% of the identified failure modes represent significant risks to the process. This distribution suggests that critical process areas are under strain, likely due to interconnected dependencies or suboptimal controls.\n  \n- **Object Type Distribution**: The failure modes span across five object types: MarketData, Client, Order, Position, and Trade. This indicates that issues are not isolated to one domain but rather spread across the broader ecosystem, hinting at potential integration or communication gaps between these objects.",
    "insights": "- **Critical Activities Concentration**: The five identified critical activities\u2014Position Reconciliation, Trade Transparency Assessment, Premium Settlement, Trade Matching, and Regulatory Reporting Generation\u2014are likely bottlenecks or high-impact areas because of their role in ensuring compliance, operational efficiency, and accurate data flow. Failures in these areas could cascade into other processes, amplifying the risk impact.",
    "recommendations": "- **Risk Severity Skew**: The presence of 104 high-risk failure modes compared to only 7 medium-risk items suggests that there may be inadequate prioritization or controls for mitigating severe risks. This lack of balance could increase systemic vulnerabilities."
