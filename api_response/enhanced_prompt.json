{"prompt": "Based on the provided event log analysis and industry context, identify object types and their relationships to activities/events for conversion into the Object-Centric Event Log (OCEL) format.\n\nIndustry Context:\n# Foreign Exchange (FX) Trading Industry Context for Object-Centric Process Mining\n\nForeign exchange trading involves the simultaneous buying of one currency and selling of another currency. The process encompasses multiple interacting objects, complex workflows, and various stakeholders, making it an ideal candidate for object-centric process mining analysis.\n\n## Core Business Objects and Their Interactions\n\nThe FX trading environment consists of several key business objects that interact throughout the trading lifecycle:\n\n### Trade Object\nA Trade represents the fundamental transaction unit in FX trading. Each trade moves through multiple stages from initiation to settlement, involving various counterparties and systems. Trades can be spot trades (settling within two business days) or forward trades (settling at a future date). Each trade carries essential attributes such as:\n- Currency pair (e.g., EUR/USD, GBP/JPY)\n- Trade amount in base currency\n- Exchange rate\n- Value date (settlement date)\n- Trade status\n- Trading venue or execution method\n\n### Order Object\nOrders represent client instructions that may result in one or multiple trades. An order maintains its own lifecycle and can be:\n- Market orders (execute immediately at current market price)\n- Limit orders (execute when price reaches specified level)\n- Stop orders (triggers when market reaches certain level)\nOrders can have multiple child trades and interact with various pricing and execution systems.\n\n### Position Object\nPositions represent the accumulated risk exposure for a particular currency pair or trading book. Positions are affected by:\n- New trades\n- Trade modifications\n- Settlement events\n- Risk transfers between books\nPositions must be continuously monitored and reconciled throughout the trading day.\n\n### Market Data Object\nMarket data feeds provide essential pricing information and include:\n- Real-time currency pair quotes\n- Reference rates\n- Yield curves\n- Volatility surfaces\nMarket data objects interact with trading decisions, risk calculations, and position valuations.\n\n### Client Object\nClients initiate trading activity and maintain ongoing relationships. Client objects contain:\n- Trading permissions\n- Credit limits\n- Preferred execution venues\n- Settlement instructions\n- Compliance requirements\n\n## Key Process Flows and Object Interactions\n\n### Pre-Trade Process\n1. Client submits trading interest\n2. System checks trading limits and permissions\n3. Market data provides pricing information\n4. Trading algorithms may analyze execution strategies\n5. Order object is created with initial parameters\n\n### Trade Execution Process\n1. Order triggers trade execution\n2. Market data influences execution price\n3. Position objects are updated\n4. Trade object is created and validated\n5. Client receives execution confirmation\n\n### Post-Trade Process\n1. Trade details are enriched\n2. Risk systems update position calculations\n3. Trade is matched with counterparty\n4. Settlement instructions are generated\n5. Trade moves to settlement phase\n\n### Settlement Process\n1. Position updates are confirmed\n2. Payment instructions are generated\n3. Nostro accounts are updated\n4. Settlement confirmation is received\n5. Trade status is updated to settled\n\n## Critical Business Rules and Relationships\n\nThe FX trading environment operates under specific business rules that affect object interactions:\n\n1. Trade Validation Rules:\n   - Trade size must be within client limits\n   - Currency pair must be permitted for client\n   - Trade must be within market hours\n   - Price must be within tolerance bands\n\n2. Position Management Rules:\n   - Position limits per currency pair\n   - Intraday exposure limits\n   - End-of-day position reconciliation\n   - Risk transfer rules between books\n\n3. Settlement Rules:\n   - Cut-off times for different currencies\n   - Holiday calendar dependencies\n   - Funding requirements\n   - Nostro account management\n\n## Event Patterns and Attributes\n\nCommon event patterns that should be captured in process mining:\n\n1. Trade Lifecycle Events:\n   - Quote Requested\n   - Order Created\n   - Trade Executed\n   - Trade Confirmed\n   - Trade Settled\n   - Trade Cancelled\n\n2. Position Events:\n   - Position Updated\n   - Risk Limit Checked\n   - Position Reconciled\n   - Risk Transfer Executed\n\n3. Market Data Events:\n   - Price Update\n   - Reference Rate Published\n   - Market Status Change\n   - Trading Hours Update\n\n## Process Mining Considerations\n\nFor effective object-centric process mining in FX trading:\n\n1. Object Relationships:\n   - Track relationships between trades and orders\n   - Monitor position changes from trades\n   - Link client activities across multiple trades\n   - Connect market data influences on execution\n\n2. Temporal Dependencies:\n   - Consider different time zones\n   - Track intraday vs. end-of-day processes\n   - Monitor settlement timing requirements\n   - Track market hours and trading windows\n\n3. Performance Indicators:\n   - Execution quality metrics\n   - Settlement efficiency\n   - Risk limit utilization\n   - Client activity patterns\n\n## Mandatory Activity Sequences (CRITICAL)\n\n### Trade Lifecycle - Strict Sequential Order\nThe following sequence MUST be maintained exactly in this order:\n\n1. Trade Initiated\n   * Mandatory first activity\n   * Creates initial trade record\n   * No trade activities can precede this\n\n2. Trade Validation\n   * Must follow Trade Initiated\n   * Must precede Trade Execution\n   * Validates all trade parameters\n\n3. Trade Execution\n   * Can only occur after validation\n   * Core trading activity\n   * Price/execution details captured\n\n4. Trade Confirmation\n   * Immediately follows execution\n   * Generates trade confirmations\n   * Must precede matching\n\n5. Trade Matching\n   * Can only occur after confirmation\n   * Matches with counterparty\n   * Required for settlement\n\n6. Trade Reconciliation\n   * Post-matching reconciliation\n   * Verifies all trade details\n   * Required before transparency\n\n7. Trade Transparency Assessment\n   * Regulatory transparency check\n   * Must occur before settlement\n   * Final pre-settlement check\n\n8. Final Settlement\n   * Mandatory final activity\n   * Cannot occur before other steps\n   * Concludes trade lifecycle\n\n### Order Object Sequential Flow\n1. Quote Requested (always first)\n2. Quote Provided\n3. Client Limit Validation\n4. Strategy Validation\n5. ISDA Master Agreement Check\n6. KYC Refresh Check\n7. Best Execution Validation\n8. Exercise Decision (for options)\n\n### Position Object Sequential Flow\n1. Initial Margin Calculation\n2. Risk Assessment\n3. Collateral Management\n4. Position Reconciliation\n\n### MarketData Object Sequential Flow\n1. Market Data Validation\n2. Volatility Surface Analysis\n3. Greeks Calculation\n4. Premium Calculation\n5. CSA Verification\n6. Transaction Reporting Check\n7. Regulatory Reporting Generation\n\n### Client Object Sequential Flow\n1. Credit Check\n2. Settlement Instructions\n3.

Unique Cases: 4\n- Available Columns: ['case_id', 'activity', 'resource', 'currency_pair', 'option_type', 'booking_system', 'client_type', 'trading_strategy', 'strike_price', 'premium', 'notional_amount', 'delta', 'gamma', 'vega', 'theta', 'risk_score', 'limit_usage']\n\nObject Identification Guidelines:\n1. **Analyze Activities to Identify Potential Business Objects:**\n   - Focus on nouns within activity descriptions that represent business entities.\n   - Consider entities that persist across multiple activities and have distinct lifecycles.\n   - Identify objects that are created, modified, or referenced by activities.\n\n2. **Activity-Object Association Rules:**\n   - Associate each activity with relevant object types based on its context.\n   - Activities such as \"Create X\" or \"Update X\" typically indicate that 'X' is an object.\n   - Ensure that each activity is linked to at least one object type.\n\n3. **Attribute Identification Guidelines:**\n   - Map relevant columns from the event log to object attributes.\n   - Convert case attributes to object attributes where appropriate.\n   - Ensure proper mapping of timestamps and resources.\n   - Include unique identifiers (e.g., IDs) as attributes for corresponding objects.\n\n4. **Relationship Identification Guidelines:**\n   - Determine how objects interact during activities.\n   - Identify parent-child or hierarchical relationships between objects.\n   - Look for objects that share common activities or are frequently associated.\n   - Consider relationships implied by foreign key references or data linkages.\n   \n5. **Activity Sequencing Rules:**\n   - Identify mandatory start activities (e.g., \"Trade Initiated\" for trades)\n   - Identify mandatory end activities (e.g., \"Final Settlement\" for trades)\n   - Maintain business process order within each object type\n   - Consider dependencies between activities\n   - Respect regulatory and operational sequences\n\n6. **Sequence Validation Rules:**\n   - Start activities must appear first in the sequence\n   - End activities must appear last in the sequence\n   - Intermediate activities must follow business logic order\n   - Validation activities must precede execution activities\n   - Settlement activities must follow execution activities\n\n7. **Cross-Object Sequence Dependencies:**\n   - Order activities must precede related Trade activities\n   - Market Data validation must precede Trade execution\n   - Position updates must follow Trade execution\n   - Client checks must precede Trade execution\n\nOutput Requirements:\n1. **JSON Structure:**\n   - Each key represents an object type name.\n   - Each object type contains the following fields:\n     - \"activities\": List of activities that create, modify, or reference this object.\n     - \"attributes\": List of data fields associated with this object.\n     - \"relationships\": List of other object types this object interacts with.\n\n2. **Naming Conventions:**\n   - Use PascalCase for object type names (e.g., \"Trade\", \"Order\").\n   - Retain original activity names from the log.\n   - Use lowercase with underscores for attribute names.\n   - Ensure consistency in relationship naming aligned with object type names.\n\nExample Output Format:\n\n{\n    \"Trade\": {\n        \"activities\": [\"Create Trade\", \"Execute Trade\", \"Modify Trade\"],\n        \"attributes\": [\"trade_id\", \"currency_pair\", \"amount\", \"trade_type\", \"status\"],\n        \"relationships\": [\"Order\", \"Position\", \"Client\"]\n    },\n    \"Order\": {\n        \"activities\": [\"Place Order\", \"Cancel Order\", \"Modify Order\"],\n        \"attributes\": [\"order_id\", \"order_type\", \"quantity\", \"price\", \"status\"],\n        \"relationships\": [\"Trade\", \"Client\", \"Account\"]\n    }\n}\n\nAdditional Instructions:\n- Ensure comprehensive mapping of all activities to relevant object types.\n- Include all pertinent attributes from the available columns.\n- Define clear and meaningful relationships between objects.\n- Validate that object types form a connected graph through their relationships.\n- Incorporate industry-specific context when defining object types and relationships.\n\nYour response must:\n1. Adhere to the exact JSON format provided in the example.\n2. Include all identified object types with their complete activities, attributes, and relationships.\n3. Maintain consistency in naming conventions and structure.\n4. Cover all activities and relevant attributes from the event log comprehensively.\n\n**Process Flow Analysis Rules:**\n1. **Activity Order Detection:**\n   - Analyze case timestamps to determine natural progression\n   - Look for temporal patterns across multiple cases\n   - Identify consistent activity sequences in the event log\n   - Consider activity names that imply order (e.g., \"Initiated\", \"Completed\", \"Final\")\n\n2. **Logical Flow Dependencies:**\n   - Creation/Initiation activities must come first\n   - Validation/Check activities must precede their target activities\n   - Core processing activities follow validation\n   - Assessment/Review activities follow processing\n   - Settlement/Completion activities come last\n   - Final/End activities must be at the end\n\n3. **Timeline-Based Sequencing:**\n   - Use timestamp analysis to validate activity order\n   - Consider minimum time gaps between activities\n   - Look for parallel vs. sequential patterns\n   - Identify activities that consistently occur early/late in cases\n   - Detect standard waiting periods between activities\n\n4. **Cross-Object Dependencies:**\n   - Identify activities that must complete in one object before another starts\n   - Consider input/output relationships between objects\n   - Maintain consistency in related object sequences\n   - Ensure dependent activities across objects maintain proper order\n\n5. **Validation Rules:**\n   - Every object type must have clear start and end activities\n   - No validation activity should follow its target execution\n   - Review activities cannot precede their subject activities\n   - Settlement activities must come after core processing\n   - Maintain logical business process flow\n\n"}
