Traditional Process Mining for FX Trade Event Logs

Step 1: Event Log Collection
The first step in process mining is to gather the event logs from your FX trading system. These logs should contain at least three essential pieces of information1:

- Case ID: A unique identifier for each FX trade
- Activity: The specific action or step in the trade process
- Timestamp: The date and time when the activity occurred
- Additional attributes such as trader ID, currency pair, trade amount, and status can provide more context for analysis.

Step 2: Data Preprocessing
Before analysis, the event log data needs to be cleaned and formatted:

- Remove incomplete or corrupted entries
- Standardize activity names and formats
- Ensure proper timestamp formatting
- Handle any missing values

Step 3: Process Discovery
In this step, process mining algorithms analyze the event log to automatically construct a process model3. This model represents the actual flow of FX trades through your system, revealing:
- The most common trade paths
- Variations in the process
- Unexpected deviations or loops

Step 4: Conformance Checking
Compare the discovered process model with the ideal or expected FX trading process1. This step helps identify:
- Compliance issues
- Deviations from standard procedures
- Potential risks or inefficiencies

Step 5: Performance Analysis
- Analyze the time between activities to identify:
- Bottlenecks in the trade settlement process
- Delays in specific steps
- Opportunities for process acceleration

Step 6: Root Cause Analysis
- Investigate the reasons behind process deviations or inefficiencies:
- Correlate performance issues with specific attributes (e.g., currency pairs, traders, time of day)
- Identify patterns that lead to failed or delayed trades

Step 7: Process Enhancement
Based on the insights gained, propose and implement improvements:
- Streamline workflows to reduce settlement times
- Automate manual interventions
- Optimize resource allocation
