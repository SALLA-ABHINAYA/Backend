Convert the uploaded file into OCEL 1.0 JSON format while ensuring that:  

        ✅ The events contain unique IDs, timestamps, activities, attributes, and related objects.
        ✅ The objects store activity-related details and key business attributes.
        ✅ The output format follows the OCEL 1.0 JSON structure.
        
        Requirements:
        - Extract relevant entity types from the dataset
        - Format timestamps in ISO 8601
        - Link each event with its objects
        - Include attributes like case_id, resource, and object_type
        
        Follow this structure:
        {{
            "ocel:version": "1.0",
            "ocel:ordering": "timestamp",
            "ocel:attribute-names": [],
            "ocel:events": [...],
            "ocel:objects": [...],
            "ocel:object-types": [...],
            "ocel:global-log": {{
                "ocel:attribute-names": []
            }}
        }}

        An object-centric process mining (OCPM), the goal is to model processes where multiple interacting objects (e.g., orders, clients, products) participate in events. The key challenge is determining what qualifies as an "object" from an event log. Let’s break down the fundamentals:
        1. What Qualifies as an Object?
        An object represents a business entity with its own lifecycle and attributes. Objects are not just event attributes; they are first-class citizens with identity and interactions. To qualify as an object, an entity must:
        Participate in multiple events (e.g., a Trade spans multiple steps).
        Have a lifecycle (e.g., a CurrencyPair might be referenced in multiple trades).
        Interact with other objects (e.g., a Client interacts with a Trade).
        
        Return only the json output without any additional text.
and i need only object types as output in this format "
Example

                name='Trade',

                    'Trade Settled', 'Trade Canceled'  # Match synthetic data activities
                ],
                attributes=['currency_pair', 'notional_amount'],
                relationships=['Market', 'Risk', 'Settlement']
            ),
            'Market': ObjectType(

                activities=[
                    'Trade Executed', 'Quote Requested', 'Quote Provided'
